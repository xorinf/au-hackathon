- [ ] Test on actual mobile device
- [ ] Prepare for "What if WiFi fails?"

### During Presentation
- [ ] Start with shocking statistic
- [ ] Show demo in first 2 minutes
- [ ] Speak with enthusiasm
- [ ] Make eye contact
- [ ] Stay under 5 minutes

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Feature creep (too many features)
- ❌ Leaving deployment for last minute
- ❌ Not practicing the demo
- ❌ Using "test data" in demo
- ❌ Going over time limit

## 📊 What Judges Score

- **Technical** (30%): Working demo, code quality
- **Innovation** (25%): Unique solution, novel features
- **Impact** (25%): Real problem, scalability
- **Presentation** (20%): Clear communication, storytelling

## 🆘 When You're Stuck

### Feature Not Working? (>30 mins stuck)
→ Move to next feature, come back later

### Demo Failing?
→ Use backup video, have screenshots ready

### Running Out of Time?
→ Reduce scope, focus on 1 core flow working perfectly

### Team Conflict?
→ Quick 10-min standup, reassign tasks
